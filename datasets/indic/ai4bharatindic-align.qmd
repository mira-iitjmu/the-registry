## Overview

The **ai4bharat/indic-align** dataset represents a comprehensive collection of instruction-following and response alignment data specifically designed for Indic languages. This dataset addresses the critical need for high-quality training data that can help language models better understand and respond to instructions across multiple Indian languages.

### Dataset Characteristics

This dataset encompasses **11+ Indic languages**, providing a rich multilingual resource for researchers and practitioners working on instruction-following tasks in the Indian linguistic context. The primary focus is on creating well-aligned instruction-response pairs that can improve the performance of language models when handling queries and commands in various Indic languages.

### Key Features

- **Multilingual Coverage**: Supports 11+ Indic languages, ensuring broad linguistic representation
- **Instruction-Following Focus**: Specifically designed for training models to follow instructions accurately
- **Response Alignment**: Contains carefully curated instruction-response pairs for optimal model training
- **Research-Backed**: Developed by AI4Bharat with accompanying research paper
